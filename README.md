# Key Elements

  * User authentication and authorization: To ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their own CVs, it's important to have a secure authentication and authorization mechanism.

  * CV template selection: The system should provide a range of CV templates for users to choose from, with options for different industries and job roles.

  * CV creation and editing: Users should be able to create and edit their CVs using an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
  * Data storage: The system should store user-generated data, such as personal details, work experience, education, and skills, in a secure and scalable database.
  * Exporting and sharing: Once a user has created a CV, they should be able to export it in various formats such as PDF or Word, and share it with potential employers.
  

# Data flow 
  * Front-end UI design: Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to select a template from a gallery of options. This could be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  * Template selection: Once the user selects a template, use JavaScript to dynamically load the appropriate template into the UI.

  * Field selection: Depending on the requirements of each template, create a set of fields for users to fill out. These could include common sections such as personal details, work experience, education, skills, etc. Again, this can be implemented using HTML and JavaScript.

  * Data storage: As the user fills out the fields, use JavaScript to capture the data and store it in a client-side data structure such as an array or object.

  * Template rendering: Once the user has entered all necessary data, use JavaScript to populate the selected template with the relevant information. This can be accomplished by dynamically updating the HTML and CSS of the template to match the data entered by the user.

  * Template switching: If the user decides to switch to a different template while editing, use JavaScript to reload the new template and update the UI accordingly. The user's data should be preserved during the transition.

  * Data submission: When the user is finished creating their CV, use JavaScript to submit the data to the back-end server for storage and processing.

  * Back-end data processing: In the back-end server, use Django to process the submitted data and store it in a database. This can involve validation, normalization, and any other necessary transformations to ensure data quality.

  * CV export: Finally, once the user's data is stored in the database, use Django to generate and export a PDF or other format of the completed CV
